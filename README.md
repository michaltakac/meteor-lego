# Meteor Lego
Meteor boilerplate using microservices

## Todo
 - Nice landing page
 - Some kind of service to whocase this approach
 - Maybe make API package as another service
 - Add Travis CI support
 - Create CLI tool for scaffoling (using shelljs)
 - Landing page with Meteor is overkill, should just be plain html/js/css
